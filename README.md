# Breast-Cancer-Prediction-Machine-Learning-Project
In this project, we have built a breast cancer prediction model. For the data set, we used the breast cancer data set comes with sklearn dataset module.
The above problem has been successfully implemented with Linear SVM algorithms with an accuracy of **92.54%**
